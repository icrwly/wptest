- For .NET projects

For each enviornment place files in "pre-build" for those that should be copied prior to compile and files that should be copied after compile in "post-build". If you are unsure the standard location is "post-build".

- For all other projects

Place files you would like copied in the desired enviornment directory (dev, qa, stage, prod).
